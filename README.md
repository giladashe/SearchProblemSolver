# *Search Problem Solver*
This program creates a serial / parallel server that connects to a client and the client sends them a problem. The server sends back the solution of the problem by checking first if the solution is in its 
cache and solves the problem otherwise. Here the problem was a matrix and we examined 4 algorithms on it â€“ BFS, DFS, A* and BestFirstSearch, 
and chose A* finally. 
    
*Getting Started*
First you'll need to create files texts of matrices separated by n\ and finally a start & goal node. The A* algorithm will send you back the most optimal path to the goal node. 
  
*Built With*
Clion - IDE by JetBrains
*Versioning*
We used [Github](https://github.com/giladashe/flightSimulator) for version control.
